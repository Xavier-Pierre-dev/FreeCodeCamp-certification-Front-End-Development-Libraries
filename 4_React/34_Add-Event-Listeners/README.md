<p>The <code>componentDidMount()</code> method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.</p>
<p>You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as <code>onClick()</code>. React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.</p>

<p>Attach an event listener in the <code>componentDidMount()</code> method for <code>keydown</code> events and have these events trigger the callback <code>handleKeyPress()</code>. You can use <code>document.addEventListener()</code> which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.</p>
<p>Then, in <code>componentWillUnmount()</code>, remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to <code>document.removeEventListener()</code>. It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.</p>
