<p>Now that you're getting comfortable writing JSX, you may be wondering how it differs from HTML.</p>
<p>So far, it may seem that HTML and JSX are exactly the same.</p>
<p>One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word <code>class</code> to define HTML classes. This is because <code>class</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses <code>className</code>.</p>
<p>In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is <code>onClick</code>, instead of <code>onclick</code>. Likewise, <code>onchange</code> becomes <code>onChange</code>. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.</p>
