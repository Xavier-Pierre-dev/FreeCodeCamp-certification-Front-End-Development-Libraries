<p>Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard <code>if/else</code> statement in the <code>render()</code> method of a React component.</p>

<p>MyComponent contains a <code>boolean</code> in its state which tracks whether you want to display some element in the UI or not. The <code>button</code> toggles the state of this value. Currently, it renders the same UI every time. Rewrite the <code>render()</code> method with an <code>if/else</code> statement so that if <code>display</code> is <code>true</code>, you return the current markup. Otherwise, return the markup without the <code>h1</code> element.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must write an <code>if/else</code> to pass the tests. Use of the ternary operator will not pass here.</p>
