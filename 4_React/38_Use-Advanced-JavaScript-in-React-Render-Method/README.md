<p>In previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, <code>{ }</code>, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.</p>
<p>You can also write JavaScript directly in your <code>render</code> methods, before the <code>return</code> statement, <em><strong>without</strong></em> inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code <em>inside</em> the <code>return</code> statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.</p>

<p>In the code provided, the <code>render</code> method has an array that contains 20 phrases to represent the answers found in the classic 1980's Magic Eight Ball toy. The button click event is bound to the <code>ask</code> method, so each time the button is clicked a random number will be generated and stored as the <code>randomIndex</code> in state. On line 52, delete the string <code>change me!</code> and reassign the <code>answer</code> const so your code randomly accesses a different index of the <code>possibleAnswers</code> array each time the component updates. Finally, insert the <code>answer</code> const inside the <code>p</code> tags.</p>
