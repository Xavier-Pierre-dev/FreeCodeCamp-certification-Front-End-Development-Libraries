<p>You may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the <code>style</code> attribute set to a JavaScript object. First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with <code>fontSize</code> instead of <code>font-size</code>. Hyphenated words like <code>font-size</code> are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.</p>
<p>All property value length units (like <code>height</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>fontSize</code>) are assumed to be in <code>px</code> unless otherwise specified. If you want to use <code>em</code>, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like <code>{fontSize: "4em"}</code>. Other than the length values that default to <code>px</code>, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.</p>
</section></div><hr/><div><section id="instructions">
<p>If you have a large set of styles, you can assign a style <code>object</code> to a constant to keep your code organized. Declare your styles constant as a global variable at the top of the file. Initialize <code>styles</code> constant and assign an <code>object</code> with three style properties and their values to it. Give the <code>div</code> a color of <code>purple</code>, a font-size of <code>40</code>, and a border of <code>2px solid purple</code>. Then set the <code>style</code> attribute equal to the <code>styles</code> constant.</p>
