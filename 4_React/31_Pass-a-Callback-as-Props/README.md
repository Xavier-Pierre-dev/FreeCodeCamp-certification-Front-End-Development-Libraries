<p>You can pass <code>state</code> as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under <code>this.props</code> in the child component.</p>

<p>There are three components outlined in the code editor. The <code>MyApp</code> component is the parent that will render the <code>GetInput</code> and <code>RenderInput</code> child components. Add the <code>GetInput</code> component to the render method in <code>MyApp</code>, then pass it a prop called <code>input</code> assigned to <code>inputValue</code> from <code>MyApp</code>'s <code>state</code>. Also create a prop called <code>handleChange</code> and pass the input handler <code>handleChange</code> to it.</p>
<p>Next, add <code>RenderInput</code> to the render method in <code>MyApp</code>, then create a prop called <code>input</code> and pass the <code>inputValue</code> from <code>state</code> to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the <code>input</code> field in the <code>GetInput</code> component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the <code>state</code> of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the <code>state</code> of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components.</p>
