<p>Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in <code>state</code> in its <code>render()</code> method. You can access the data with <code>this.state</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to access a state value within the <code>return</code> of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.</p>
<p><code>state</code> is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.</p>
<p>Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its <code>state</code>. Its <code>state</code> is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as <code>props</code>. This notion of encapsulated <code>state</code> is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.</p>

<p>In the code editor, <code>MyComponent</code> is already stateful. Define an <code>h1</code> tag in the component's render method which renders the value of <code>name</code> from the component's state.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>h1</code> should only render the value from <code>state</code> and nothing else. In JSX, any code you write with curly braces <code>{ }</code> will be treated as JavaScript. So to access the value from <code>state</code> just enclose the reference in curly braces.</p>
