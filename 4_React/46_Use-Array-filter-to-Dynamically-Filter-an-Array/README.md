<p>The <code>map</code> array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. Another method related to <code>map</code> is <code>filter</code>, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property <code>online</code> which can be set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">let</span> onlineUsers <span class="token operator">=</span> users<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">filter</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">user</span> <span class="token operator">=&gt;</span> user<span class="token punctuation">.</span>online<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In the code editor, <code>MyComponent</code>'s <code>state</code> is initialized with an array of users. Some users are online and some aren't. Filter the array so you see only the users who are online. To do this, first use <code>filter</code> to return a new array containing only the users whose <code>online</code> property is <code>true</code>. Then, in the <code>renderOnline</code> variable, map over the filtered array, and return a <code>li</code> element for each user that contains the text of their <code>username</code>. Be sure to include a unique <code>key</code> as well, like in the last challenges.</p>
