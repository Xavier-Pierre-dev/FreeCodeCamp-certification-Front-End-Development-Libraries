<p>The previous challenges covered component <code>state</code> and how to initialize state in the <code>constructor</code>. There is also a way to change the component's <code>state</code>. React provides a method for updating component <code>state</code> called <code>setState</code>. You call the <code>setState</code> method within your component class like so: <code>this.setState()</code>, passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a <code>username</code> in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:</p>
<pre class="language-jsx"><code class="language-jsx">this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
});
</code></pre>
<p>React expects you to never modify <code>state</code> directly, instead always use <code>this.setState()</code> when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the <code>setState</code> method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the <code>setState</code> method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! Please consult the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">React documentation</a> for further details.</p>

<p>There is a <code>button</code> element in the code editor which has an <code>onClick()</code> handler. This handler is triggered when the <code>button</code> receives a click event in the browser, and runs the <code>handleClick</code> method defined on <code>MyComponent</code>. Within the <code>handleClick</code> method, update the component <code>state</code> using <code>this.setState()</code>. Set the <code>name</code> property in <code>state</code> to equal the string <code>React Rocks!</code>.</p>
<p>Click the button and watch the rendered state update. Don't worry if you don't fully understand how the click handler code works at this point. It's covered in upcoming challenges.</p>
