<p>The last several challenges covered the basic ways to pass props to child components. But what if the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component? The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.</p>
<p>Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the <code>this</code> keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with <code>this</code>. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called <code>data</code>, you write <code>{this.props.data}</code> in JSX.</p>

<p>Render an instance of the <code>ReturnTempPassword</code> component in the parent component <code>ResetPassword</code>. Here, give <code>ReturnTempPassword</code> a prop of <code>tempPassword</code> and assign it a value of a string that is at least 8 characters long. Within the child, <code>ReturnTempPassword</code>, access the <code>tempPassword</code> prop within the <code>strong</code> tags to make sure the user sees the temporary password.</p>
