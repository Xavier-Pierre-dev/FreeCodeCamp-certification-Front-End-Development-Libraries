<p>The last challenge showed that React can control the internal state for certain elements like <code>input</code> and <code>textarea</code>, which makes them controlled components. This applies to other form elements as well, including the regular HTML <code>form</code> element.</p>
</section></div><hr/><div><section id="instructions">
<p>The <code>MyForm</code> component is set up with an empty <code>form</code> with a submit handler. The submit handler will be called when the form is submitted.</p>
<p>We've added a button which submits the form. You can see it has the <code>type</code> set to <code>submit</code> indicating it is the button controlling the form. Add the <code>input</code> element in the <code>form</code> and set its <code>value</code> and <code>onChange()</code> attributes like the last challenge. You should then complete the <code>handleSubmit</code> method so that it sets the component state property <code>submit</code> to the current input value in the local <code>state</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You also must call <code>event.preventDefault()</code> in the submit handler, to prevent the default form submit behavior which will refresh the web page.</p>
<p>Finally, create an <code>h1</code> tag after the <code>form</code> which renders the <code>submit</code> value from the component's <code>state</code>. You can then type in the form and click the button (or press enter), and you should see your input rendered to the page.</p>
