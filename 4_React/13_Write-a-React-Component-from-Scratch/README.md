<p>Now that you've learned the basics of JSX and React components, it's time to write a component on your own. React components are the core building blocks of React applications so it's important to become very familiar with writing them. Remember, a typical React component is an ES6 <code>class</code> which extends <code>React.Component</code>. It has a render method that returns HTML (from JSX) or <code>null</code>. This is the basic form of a React component. Once you understand this well, you will be prepared to start building more complex React projects.</p>

<p>Define a class <code>MyComponent</code> that extends <code>React.Component</code>. Its render method should return a <code>div</code> that contains an <code>h1</code> tag with the text: <code>My First React Component!</code> in it. Use this text exactly, the case and punctuation matter. Make sure to call the constructor for your component, too.</p>
<p>Render this component to the DOM using <code>ReactDOM.render()</code>. There is a <code>div</code> with <code>id='challenge-node'</code> available for you to use.</p>
