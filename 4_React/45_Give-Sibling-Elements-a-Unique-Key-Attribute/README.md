<p>The last challenge showed how the <code>map</code> method is used to dynamically render a number of elements based on user input. However, there was an important piece missing from that example. When you create an array of elements, each one needs a <code>key</code> attribute set to a unique value. React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.</p>

<p>The code editor has an array with some front end frameworks and a stateless functional component named <code>Frameworks()</code>. <code>Frameworks()</code> needs to map the array to an unordered list, much like in the last challenge. Finish writing the <code>map</code> callback to return an <code>li</code> element for each framework in the <code>frontEndFrameworks</code> array. This time, make sure to give each <code>li</code> a <code>key</code> attribute, set to a unique value. The <code>li</code> elements should also contain text from <code>frontEndFrameworks</code>.</p>
<p>Normally, you want to make the key something that uniquely identifies the element being rendered. As a last resort the array index may be used, but typically you should try to use a unique identification.</p>
