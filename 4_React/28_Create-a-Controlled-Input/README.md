<p>Your application may have more complex interactions between <code>state</code> and the rendered UI. For example, form control elements for text input, such as <code>input</code> and <code>textarea</code>, maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types. With React, you can move this mutable state into a React component's <code>state</code>. The user's input becomes part of the application <code>state</code>, so React controls the value of that input field. Typically, if you have React components with input fields the user can type into, it will be a controlled input form.</p>
</section></div><hr/><div><section id="instructions">
<p>The code editor has the skeleton of a component called <code>ControlledInput</code> to create a controlled <code>input</code> element. The component's <code>state</code> is already initialized with an <code>input</code> property that holds an empty string. This value represents the text a user types into the <code>input</code> field.</p>
<p>First, create a method called <code>handleChange()</code> that has a parameter called <code>event</code>. When the method is called, it receives an <code>event</code> object that contains a string of text from the <code>input</code> element. You can access this string with <code>event.target.value</code> inside the method. Update the <code>input</code> property of the component's <code>state</code> with this new string.</p>
<p>In the <code>render</code> method, create the <code>input</code> element above the <code>h4</code> tag. Add a <code>value</code> attribute which is equal to the <code>input</code> property of the component's <code>state</code>. Then add an <code>onChange()</code> event handler set to the <code>handleChange()</code> method.</p>
<p>When you type in the input box, that text is processed by the <code>handleChange()</code> method, set as the <code>input</code> property in the local <code>state</code>, and rendered as the value in the <code>input</code> box on the page. The component <code>state</code> is the single source of truth regarding the input data.</p>
<p>Last but not least, don't forget to add the necessary bindings in the constructor.</p>
