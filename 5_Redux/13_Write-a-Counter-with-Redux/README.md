<p>Now you've learned all the core principles of Redux! You've seen how to create actions and action creators, create a Redux store, dispatch your actions against the store, and design state updates with pure reducers. You've even seen how to manage complex state with reducer composition and handle asynchronous actions. These examples are simplistic, but these concepts are the core principles of Redux. If you understand them well, you're ready to start building your own Redux app. The next challenges cover some of the details regarding <code>state</code> immutability, but first, here's a review of everything you've learned so far.</p>

<p>In this lesson, you'll implement a simple counter with Redux from scratch. The basics are provided in the code editor, but you'll have to fill in the details! Use the names that are provided and define <code>incAction</code> and <code>decAction</code> action creators, the <code>counterReducer()</code>, <code>INCREMENT</code> and <code>DECREMENT</code> action types, and finally the Redux <code>store</code>. Once you're finished you should be able to dispatch <code>INCREMENT</code> or <code>DECREMENT</code> actions to increment or decrement the state held in the <code>store</code>. Good luck building your first Redux app!</p>
