<p>Another method you have access to on the Redux <code>store</code> object is <code>store.subscribe()</code>. This allows you to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenever an action is dispatched against the store. One simple use for this method is to subscribe a function to your store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated.</p>

<p>Write a callback function that increments the global variable <code>count</code> every time the store receives an action, and pass this function in to the <code>store.subscribe()</code> method. You'll see that <code>store.dispatch()</code> is called three times in a row, each time directly passing in an action object. Watch the console output between the action dispatches to see the updates take place.</p>
