<p>The last several challenges worked with arrays, but there are ways to help enforce state immutability when state is an <code>object</code>, too. A useful tool for handling objects is the <code>Object.assign()</code> utility. <code>Object.assign()</code> takes a target object and source objects and maps properties from the source objects to the target object. Any matching properties are overwritten by properties in the source objects. This behavior is commonly used to make shallow copies of objects by passing an empty object as the first argument followed by the object(s) you want to copy. Here's an example:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> newObject <span class="token operator">=</span> Object<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">assign</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> obj1<span class="token punctuation">,</span> obj2<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This creates <code>newObject</code> as a new <code>object</code>, which contains the properties that currently exist in <code>obj1</code> and <code>obj2</code>.</p>

<p>The Redux state and actions were modified to handle an <code>object</code> for the <code>state</code>. Edit the code to return a new <code>state</code> object for actions with type <code>ONLINE</code>, which set the <code>status</code> property to the string <code>online</code>. Try to use <code>Object.assign()</code> to complete the challenge.</p>
