<p>Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The <code>btn-danger</code> class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a cat photo.</p>
<p>Create a button with the text <code>Delete</code> and give it the class <code>btn-danger</code>.</p>
<p>Note that these buttons still need the <code>btn</code> and <code>btn-block</code> classes.</p>
