<p>We will make a simple heading for our Cat Photo App by putting the title and relaxing cat image in the same row.</p>
<p>Remember, Bootstrap uses a responsive grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a <code>div</code> element.</p>
<p>Nest your first image and your <code>h2</code> element within a single <code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;</code> element. Nest your <code>h2</code> element within a <code>&lt;div class="col-xs-8"&gt;</code> and your image in a <code>&lt;div class="col-xs-4"&gt;</code> so that they are on the same line.</p>
<p>Notice how the image is now just the right size to fit along the text?</p>
