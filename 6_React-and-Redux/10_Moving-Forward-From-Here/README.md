<p>Congratulations! You finished the lessons on React and Redux. There's one last item worth pointing out before you move on. Typically, you won't write React apps in a code editor like this. This challenge gives you a glimpse of what the syntax looks like if you're working with npm and a file system on your own machine. The code should look similar, except for the use of <code>import</code> statements (these pull in all of the dependencies that have been provided for you in the challenges). The "Managing Packages with npm" section covers npm in more detail.</p>
<p>Finally, writing React and Redux code generally requires some configuration. This can get complicated quickly. If you are interested in experimenting on your own machine, the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Create React App</a> comes configured and ready to go.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can enable Babel as a JavaScript Preprocessor in CodePen, add React and ReactDOM as external JavaScript resources, and work there as well.</p>
