<p>Now we're ready to learn jQuery, the most popular JavaScript tool of all time.</p>
<p>Before we can start using jQuery, we need to add some things to our HTML.</p>
<p>First, add a <code>script</code> element at the top of your page. Be sure to close it on the following line.</p>
<p>Your browser will run any JavaScript inside a <code>script</code> element, including jQuery.</p>
<p>Inside your <code>script</code> element, add this code: <code>$(document).ready(function() {</code> to your <code>script</code>. Then close it on the following line (still inside your <code>script</code> element) with: <code>});</code></p>
<p>We'll learn more about <code>functions</code> later. The important thing to know is that code you put inside this <code>function</code> will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.</p>
<p>This is important because without your <code>document ready function</code>, your code may run before your HTML is rendered, which would cause bugs.</p>
